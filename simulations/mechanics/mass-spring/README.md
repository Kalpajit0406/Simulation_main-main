# Mass-Spring System Simulation

This document provides instructions and details for using the Mass-Spring System simulation.

## Overview

The Mass-Spring System simulation allows users to explore the dynamics of a mass attached to a spring. Users can adjust parameters such as mass, spring constant, damping, and amplitude to observe how these factors influence the motion of the system.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Simulation**: Navigate to the `mass-spring/index.html` file in your web browser to launch the simulation.

2. **Controls**: 
   - **Mass (kg)**: Adjust the mass of the object attached to the spring.
   - **Spring Constant (N/m)**: Change the stiffness of the spring.
   - **Damping**: Modify the damping factor to see how it affects the oscillation.
   - **Amplitude (m)**: Set the initial displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.

3. **Start/Reset**: Use the "Start" button to begin the simulation and the "Reset" button to return to the initial state.

4. **Data Display**: The simulation displays real-time data including time, position, velocity, and acceleration of the mass.

5. **Graphing**: You can toggle the visibility of position, velocity, and acceleration graphs to visualize the motion over time.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) is recommended for the best experience.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the simulation, ensure that your browser allows JavaScript and that you are not blocking any scripts.
