# Buoyancy Simulator

## Overview
The Buoyancy Simulator is an interactive physics simulation that allows users to explore the principles of buoyancy and Archimedes' principle. Users can manipulate various parameters such as object density, volume, and fluid density to observe how these factors affect buoyancy.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulation**: Users can drag and drop objects into a fluid environment to see how they behave under different conditions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the density and volume of objects, as well as the density of the fluid and gravitational acceleration.
- **Visual Feedback**: The simulation provides real-time visual feedback, including force arrows and submerged volume indicators.
- **Water Textures and Animations**: The simulator includes realistic water textures and animations to enhance the visual experience.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the simulation interface.
- **style.css**: Contains styles for the simulator, defining layout, colors, and visual aspects.
- **main.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the simulation logic, including physics calculations and rendering.
- **textures/**: A directory containing texture files used for the water and objects in the simulation.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Open in Browser**: Navigate to the `buoyancy-simulator` directory and open `index.html` in a web browser to run the simulation.
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the controls provided in the interface to modify the properties of the objects and fluid.

## Dependencies
- No external libraries are required to run the buoyancy simulator. All necessary code is included in the project files.
