# Textures for Buoyancy Simulator

This directory contains the texture files used in the Buoyancy Simulator project. The textures enhance the visual representation of the simulation, particularly the water surface and objects.

## Usage

To use the textures in your simulation, ensure that the texture files are correctly referenced in your JavaScript code. The textures can be applied to the canvas rendering context to create realistic water effects and object appearances.

## Textures Included

- **water_texture.png**: A seamless texture for the water surface.
- **object_texture.png**: A texture for the objects used in the simulation.

## Licensing

Please check the individual texture files for licensing information. Ensure that you comply with any usage restrictions or requirements specified by the texture authors.
