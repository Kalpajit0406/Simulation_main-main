## Getting Started

To get started with the simulations, open the `landing.html` file in your web browser. From there, you can navigate to either the Mass-Spring System or the Simple Pendulum simulation.

## Usage Instructions

### Mass-Spring System
- Adjust the mass, spring constant, damping, and amplitude using the provided controls.
- Click "Start" to begin the simulation and observe the motion of the mass-spring system.
- Use the "Reset" button to return to the initial state.

### Simple Pendulum
- Modify the mass, length, damping, and initial angle using the controls.
- Click "Start" to initiate the pendulum motion and watch the oscillations.
- The "Reset" button will restore the pendulum to its starting position.

## Conclusion
